**Description of Images:**

- **Input**  
  The original brain MRI slice provided as input to the model.

- **GT (Ground Truth)**  
  The manually annotated stroke lesion regions from the dataset.  
  This represents the correct segmentation used for evaluation.

- **Prediction**  
  The segmentation mask generated by the trained **2D nnU-Net model**, highlighting the detected stroke lesion area.
